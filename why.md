# ‚ù§Ô∏è Why Ruby?

This project grew out of a rekindled love for learning programming languages (and not just vibe-coding!!) and a deeper understanding of what makes this language so special. Inspired by [David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH)](https://twitter.com/dhh)'s conversation with [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/podcast), here's a summary of DHH's thoughts on how he fell in love with Ruby‚Äîand what makes it still matter.

---

## üéÆ Early Struggles

DHH tried coding as a kid (Amstrad 464, Amiga 500), but it didn't stick. Programming felt too abstract‚Äîhe couldn't get past typos or the "why" behind concepts like variables. He felt like maybe coding just wasn't for him.

* This is a really #felt perspective behind my life-long programming journey.

## üåê Rediscovering the Joy

Later, while building websites in high school, HTML gave him immediate feedback. That was the magic. PHP followed‚Äîand it worked! But while PHP felt powerful, it didn't feel joyful.

* I too began my programming journey by building websites and I think it was indeed the immediate feedback that helped motivate me. 

---

## üíé Then Came Ruby

When DHH read Martin Fowler and Dave Thomas writing Ruby to explain design patterns, something clicked. Ruby wasn't just functional‚Äîit was beautiful.

> "It felt like a glove made for my brain by someone I'd never met."

Ruby was expressive, human-readable, and empowering. Unlike Java or even Python, Ruby trusted the developer. You could read it like English. You could write `5.days` or `user.downgrade unless user.admin?` and it just made sense.

* This discussion was wha made me want to dig further into Ruby and why I began this project.

## üß† Thinking Through Code

DHH sees code as a tool for thought. Ruby lets you *think out loud*, shape your ideas, and express yourself. Typing code is learning. Watching AI generate code skips the growth.

> "Typing is like playing guitar. You don't become great by watching someone else strum."

* Like most developers these days, I find myself leaning on AI quite a bit... and it does scare me. It makes me worry that I am missing out on the opportunity to learn, which was my main motivation for studying computer science and going "all-in" on my software engineering journey over the last decade--i.e., a LOVE for learning.

---

## üîÆ Dynamic Typing, On Purpose

Some criticize Ruby's dynamic typing, but DHH defends it: fewer fences, more freedom. Combine that with tests and metaprogramming, and Ruby becomes a language you can bend to your will.

He even used Ruby's metaprogramming to invent DSLs like `has_many :comments` in Rails‚Äîcode that feels like native language.

* I am eager to lean into dynamic typing and to learn about metaprogramming. Just today I was discussing how our company's front-end engineers use TypeScript and it was really interesting hearing DHH say how frustrating building with TS was--it felt like another sign that learning Ruby would prove fruitful.

---

## üõ† Rails and Beyond

DHH built **Ruby on Rails** to bring the joy of Ruby to the masses‚Äîwhether you're a solo dev or powering Shopify-scale systems.

Ruby and Rails are about **programmer happiness**, not premature optimization.

* I have messed with Rails a few times over the last 20 years and each time I found it kind of annoying. LOL! I think coming back to it with my last decade of more intense programming focus will provide a great pair of new "eyes" through which to see if it was really Rails that was annoying or just impatience with learning a new framework.

## ü§ñ AI Can Assist, But Not Replace

He uses tools like Claude to explore ideas, debug, and get inspired. But he refuses to give up writing code.

> "I'd rather retire than become a project manager for AI."

* Exactly, David. EXACTLY.

---

## üåü Why Ruby?

* Human-first, expressive syntax
* Built-in joy and aesthetics
* Encourages clean thinking
* Supports DSLs and creative design
* Still the best tool for building with joy

This repo‚Äîjust like this project‚Äîis a love letter to programming. Let's track our time and fall in love with code again. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üìú TL;DR How DHH‚ÄØ(David‚ÄØHeinemeier‚ÄØHansson) got from "Maybe I'm not a programmer" to *Ruby on¬†Rails*

| Stage                                              | Key moments & take‚Äëaways                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Early false starts**                             | *Assembler/BASIC/C++* in the 1990s felt opaque; DHH concluded he "just wasn't a coding person."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **HTML & PHP tinkering**                           | Building web pages for clients finally produced visible results, but PHP felt like "a tool, not a language you love."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **The Ruby epiphany (‚âà‚ÄØ2003)**                     | ‚Ä¢ Read Martin‚ÄØFowler & Dave‚ÄØThomas praising Ruby.<br>‚Ä¢ First script looked like pseudocode‚Äî*readable, tiny, joyful.*<br>‚Ä¢ Realized code could be written "for humans first, machines second."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Why Ruby stuck**                                 | ‚Ä¢ **Expressiveness** ‚Äì almost English‚Äëlike; low ceremony ("`puts \"Hello\"`" is the whole program).<br>‚Ä¢ **Metaprogramming** ‚Äì lets you create mini‚ÄëDSLs (`has_many :comments`) that match your domain.<br>‚Ä¢ **Dynamic by design** ‚Äì trusts the programmer; tests guard the rest.<br>‚Ä¢ **Soft learning ramp, infinite ceiling** ‚Äì beginners are productive in hours, yet veterans still learn new tricks years later.<br>‚Ä¢ **Programmer happiness** ‚Äì Matz's prime directive resonated. |
| **Rails: turning the joy into a framework (2004)** | ‚Ä¢ Needed a web toolkit for a Basecamp prototype; wrote 37‚ÄØhours a week for \~400‚ÄØhours.<br>‚Ä¢ Rails distilled Ruby's "write software like prose" ideal into conventions (Convention‚Äëover‚ÄëConfiguration, "The menu is‚ÄØOmakase").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Learning philosophy**                            | ‚Ä¢ **"Write code yourself."** Watching videos or letting AI generate code is fitness‚Äëvideo learning: feels real, teaches little.<br>‚Ä¢ Code is a *thinking* medium‚Äîtyping crystallizes ideas.<br>‚Ä¢ Flow state matters more than type safety; Ruby keeps you in flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Tools & environment**                            | ‚Ä¢ Loves minimal, distraction‚Äëfree setup: one large monitor, vim/neovim today, mechanical keyboard, Linux after years on macOS.<br>‚Ä¢ AI assistants are fine for stubs, but he'd "quit before becoming an AI project manager."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Advice to beginners**                            | 1. Start with Ruby (then Rails if you're web‚Äëbound).<br>2. Build something **you** want; let that drive what you learn.<br>3. Later add JavaScript (browser) and Go (infra) as complements‚Äîbut keep Ruby as your thinking tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**In one sentence:**
Ruby flipped DHH's self‚Äëimage from "I can't code" to "code is literature," gave him a language that stays out of the way, and remains the foundation for his joy‚Äëdriven approach to building software‚Äîand to teaching others to do the same.
